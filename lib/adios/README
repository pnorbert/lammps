The Makefile.lammps file in this directory is used when building LAMMPS with
its USER-ADUIS package installed.  The file has several settings needed to
compile and link LAMMPS with the ADIOS library.  
Edit Makefile.lammps before building LAMMPS itself. 

To illustrate, these are example settings. We suggest to use the 
adios_config binary to determine the link options for the actual 
adios installation. 

ADIOS_DIR = /opt/adios
adios_SYSINC = -I${ADIOS_DIR}/include
adios_SYSLIB = `${ADIOS_DIR}/bin/adios_config -l`
adios_SYSPATH =

adios_SYSINC refers to the include directory of the installed ADIOS library

adios_SYSLIB refers to the libraries needed to link to from an application
(LAMMPS in this case) to "embed" ADIOS in the application. ADIOS may depend on
various other libraries which are needed when using the USER-ADIOS package.

adios_SYSPATH = refers to the path (e.g. -L/usr/local/lib) where the dependent libraries
can be found. You may need to use this setting if the path of a dependent library is not included in
your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
